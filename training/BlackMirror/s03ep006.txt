Hated in the Nation
To counteract near-extinction of bees, Granular has developed robotic bees called "Autonomous Drone Insects" (ADIs). DCI Karin Parke and Detective Blue Coulson, with the help of the National Crime Agency agent Shaun Li, discover that rogue ADIs caused the deaths of two people, both subjects of the "#DeathTo" hashtag after gathering recent hate on social media. The hashtag was spread by a person who is running a "Game of Consequences" where the person most-mentioned alongside the hashtag is killed each day. They try to save the new target, but ADIs swarm the safe house and kill her. The public and news media become aware of the game as Blue traces the hashtag to a former Granular employee Garrett Scholes. A hacking toolkit of Scholes' is found, which Li insists on using to deactivate the ADI system. However, this was part of Scholes' plan and almost 400,000 people—everyone who used the hashtag—are killed by ADIs. Karin appears in court over the incident, while Blue has tracked Scholes down.
