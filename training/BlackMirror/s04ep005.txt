Metalhead
The episode is filmed in black and white. Bella journeys to a warehouse with Anthony and Clarke. A robotic guard known as a "dog" kills Anthony and chases the others as they drive away in separate cars. The dog jumps into Clarke's car and kills him, then pursues Bella in it. The dog enters Bella's car, and she exits as the car topples off the edge of a cliff. Via walkie-talkie, Bella leaves someone a brief message for her loved ones in case of death. The dog finds her and she climbs a tree to escape it, draining it of power by throwing things at it. As it recharges, she makes her way into a compound. When the dog tracks her down, she blinds it with paint and destroys it with a shotgun, but its shrapnel embeds trackers in her body, including one in her jugular vein. She says a final goodbye into a walkie-talkie, unsure if she can be heard. As she puts a knife to her throat, dogs swarm over the area, including the warehouse where Bella and her friends were trying to retrieve a box of teddy bears.
