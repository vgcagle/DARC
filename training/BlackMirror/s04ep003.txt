Crocodile
Rob hits a cyclist on a mountain road, killing him; with his companion Mia he throws the body into a lake. Fifteen years later, Rob visits her to talk about sending an anonymous letter to the victim's wife. Afraid the letter would be traced, Mia kills Rob. Later, an insurance investigator Shazia researches an unrelated car accident and learns that Mia saw it out of the window that evening. Shazia uses a "Recaller" to view people's memories, as best as they can picture them. Shazia speaks to Mia, who sees Mia's memories of both of her killings, despite Mia trying to stop herself thinking about them. Mia ties Shazia up, uses the Recaller to discover Shazia told her husband about the visit, and kills Shazia. Mia journeys to kill Shazia's husband and also kills their baby son to avoid leaving evidence. However, the son was born blind and the family guinea pig observed Mia, so police track Mia down to her son's school production.
