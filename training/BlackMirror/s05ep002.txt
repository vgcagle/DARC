Smithereens
At group therapy, Chris meets Hayley, whose daughter died by suicide. He has sex with her and watches her make her daily three attempts to log into her daughter's account on Persona. One day, Chris—a rideshare driver—abducts Jaden, an intern at the social media company Smithereen, at gunpoint. Police chase after them until Chris comes to a stop in a field. Chris contacts Jaden's superior and demands to speak to Smithereen's CEO Billy Bauer, who is on a solitary retreat. Smithereen employees gather information on Chris while he forces the hostage negotiator to leave. After a final ultimatum from Chris, Billy agrees to speak to him. Chris explains that he was checking a Smithereen notification while driving when a drunk driver collided with him, killing the driver and Chris's fiancée. Chris makes clear his intention to kill himself, and as a favour Billy gets Persona's CEO to give Hayley her daughter's password. Jaden tries to force Chris's gun away from him to prevent his suicide, and a police sniper is ordered to shoot into the car.
