Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too
Rachel and Jack live with their father, who is working on a mousetrap alternative. For her fifteenth birthday, Rachel gets an AI toy, Ashley Too, based on the pop star Ashley O. She dances to an Ashley O song at a school talent competition, but falls and leaves embarrassed. Meanwhile, Ashley O is beginning to rebel against Catherineâ€”her controlling manager and aunt. Catherine puts medication in her food to render Ashley O comatose. When the Ashley Too doll learns of Ashley O's coma, it malfunctions. Jack uses her father's computer to remove a limiter on the doll, causing it to gain full consciousness, as it was made from a clone of Ashley O. Rachel and Jack go with the doll to Ashley O's house. While Jack poses as a mouse catcher, Rachel and Ashley Too unplug Ashley O from a medication drip and she regains consciousness. After rendering two of Catherine's staff unconscious, they crash a venue where Catherine is unveiling Ashley Eternal, a holographic Ashley O to perform on music tours, and reveal that Ashley O is awake. Later, Ashley O performs alternative music with Jack under the name "Ashley Fuckn O".
