Fifteen Million Merits
Bing lives in a society where the majority of people ride stationary bikes in exchange for "merits", a currency used to buy essentials and virtual entertainment. His bedroom is covered from head to toe in screens and he watches another one as he rides the bike. One day, he hears Abi singing in the bathroom and convinces her to enter the talent show Hot Shot, paying almost his entire savings for her ticket. She sings "Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)" by Irma Thomas but the judges say they cannot hire another singer and she is instead coerced into becoming a pornographic performer. Later, Bing is unable to pay the merits to skip a pornographic advert starring Abi and is tormented by the images. He lives frugally until he can afford another ticket, for himself, and threatens to commit suicide when onstage. The judges give him a regular show in which he rails against the system he lives in.
