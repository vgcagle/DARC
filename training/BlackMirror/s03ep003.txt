Shut Up and Dance
A hacker records Kenny masturbating via his webcam and threatens to release it unless he follows their instructions. Kenny picks up a cake from another blackmailed individual and takes it to a hotel room where Hector was waiting to commit adultery with a sex worker. The hackers contact Hector, who complies with their commands to avoid losing custody of his children. Kenny and Hector drive to a bank and Kenny robs it at gunpoint. Hector drives Kenny to the woods to drop off the money and leaves to dispose of the car. Another blackmailed person explains to Kenny that they must fight to the death over the money while filmed by a drone. Kenny tries to shoot himself, but the gun is empty. Later, staggering out of the woods, Kenny discovers that the hackers have released the footage. His distraught mother calls him, having learned that he was masturbating to child pornography, as police swarm the area.
