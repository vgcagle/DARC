Be Right Back
Martha's boyfriend Ash is killed while returning a hire van, the day after they move into a new house in the countryside. Martha learns she is pregnant and tests a service that her friend signed her up to: by aggregating Ash's many social media posts and online communications, an artificial intelligence (AI) imitation of Ash is created. Martha interacts with him via instant messaging and video call, talking on countryside walks and neglecting her sister's attempts to reach out. The next stage is a physical android version of Ash, which begins to make Martha uncomfortable. She argues with him and takes him to a cliff where she orders him to jump, but Martha is then frustrated as the real Ash would not obey such a command. Several years later, on Martha's daughter's birthday, her daughter takes a slice of cake to the android Ash kept in the attic, which she is only permitted to visit on weekends.
