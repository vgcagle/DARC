Hang the DJ
Frank and Amy use an electronic device called "Coach" which chooses their relationship partners and durations. Coach will eventually assign them lifelong partners, with a 99.8% success rate. They are matched for 12 hours, and then each given a match lasting several months. Amy's ends and she is given a series of 36-hour relationships; when Frank's ends, the pair are rematched. They get on well until Frank violates an agreement they had not to look at the expiry dateâ€”initially five years, but his action causes Coach to recalculate the period to 20 hours. Amy and Frank leave on bad terms but fail to enjoy future matches. The day before they are paired with their lifelong partners, they reunite and Amy encourages Frank to rebel. As they escape, the world fades away: it was a simulated reality used by a dating app to determine the real-life Frank and Amy's compatibility.
