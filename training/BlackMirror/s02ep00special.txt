White Christmas
In a cabin, Matt and Joe talk about their past. Matt used to run an online group who watched each other seduce women through "Z-Eyes" that record vision and hearing. It ended after a mentally ill woman poisoned one of the attendees in a murder–suicide. Matt's former profession was training "cookies"—digital clones of people stored in an egg-shaped object—as personal assistants. Meanwhile, Joe's wife "blocked" him with the Z-Eyes, so that he could not communicate with her, after an argument over her planned abortion. Joe travelled to Beth's father's house each Christmas to spy on Beth and the child—who she kept, but who Joe also cannot see. After Beth's death, he was able to see the child, but he was not the father. Joe confronted Beth's father and killed him, leaving the daughter to freeze to death. Matt reveals that they are both in a cookie, and Joe has just confessed to his crimes. Joe will be imprisoned, while Matt is registered as a sex offender and blocked by everybody. Meanwhile, as punishment, a law enforcement officer sets the time inside Joe's cookie to run at 1,000 years per minute.
