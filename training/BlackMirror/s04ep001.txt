USS Callister
Callister Inc. produces the multiplayer game Infinity, with James Walton as CEO and Robert Daly, the brains behind the game, as the little-recognised CTO. Robert has created a version of the game modelled after his favourite series, where the characters—the crew of the starship USS Callister—are sentient clones of his co-workers. After Robert adds a new programmer, Nanette Cole, to the game, she is distressed and confused, and does not obey his commands until he causes her intense pain and shows the scope of his power. During his absences she devises an escape, though James is reluctant to join as Robert once brought his son into the game and threw him out of an airlock. Nanette finds a way to blackmail her real-life self into distracting Robert for long enough for them to steal his in-game "omnicorder", which controls the world, and begin to escape. Robert resumes playing and chases them, but they escape, which causes the game to break with Robert inside. The crew enter the real Infinity game as players.
