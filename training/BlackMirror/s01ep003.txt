Entire History of You
With the implantation of a device called a "grain" behind their ear, people can replay their memories through their eyes or on a screen. At a dinner party, Liam is suspicious of his wife Ffion's behaviour towards her friend Jonas. Upon returning home, Ffion reveals a former relationship with Jonas, though some of her details are inconsistent. Liam drinks alcohol continually throughout the night and then heads to Jonas' house. On threat of glassing, Liam forces Jonas to delete every stored memory he has of Ffion. Liam crashes his car and when he regains consciousness, he replays his memories and notices one of Jonas's memories was of Ffion in bed. Liam confronts Ffion, who continues to lie, and forces her to show her memory of having sex with Jonas around the time her baby was conceived. Later, alone in the house, Liam uses a razor to try to remove his grain.
