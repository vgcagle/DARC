Playtest
After Cooper's father dies, Cooper travels the world and avoids his mother's calls. He spends a night with Sonja in London and, after being victim to identity theft, finds a paid offer to playtest an experimental game. He tests an augmented reality version of Whac-A-Mole and meets Shou, the company's owner. In a mansion, Cooper tests a horror game where an artificial neural network learns from his fears. After fighting with a simulated Sonja, Katie tells Cooper that the technology should not cause him physical pain and leads him to a room where the test can be terminated. In the room, Cooper loses his memories and Katie and Shou say that the technology has advanced too far to be removed. Cooper then awakens in Shou's office, all subsequent events having been simulated. He returns home to find his mother unable to recognise him. However, Cooper's entire experience—from Whac-a-Mole onwards—was contained in the 0.04 second-long experiment. He died during the experiment when a phone call from his mother caused electrical interference.
