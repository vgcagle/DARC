Arkangel
Marie briefly loses her three-year-old daughter Sara and decides to have her implanted with the Arkangel system, whereby Marie can track Sara's vision, hearing and health via a tablet computer. A filter censors Sara from seeing or hearing stressful situations. After nine-year-old Sara makes herself bleed, Marie deactivates the filter and puts the tablet in the attic. One night when Sara is fifteen, Marie discovers she is lying about her whereabouts and, in distress, retrieves the tablet. Marie sees Sara having sex for the first time with Trick. Marie begins using the tablet in secret; she forces Trick to avoid Sara after he gives her cocaine, and sneaks an emergency contraception pill into Sara's smoothie. Sara discovers Marie is using the tablet and beats her with it, causing the stress filter to be reactivated so that she cannot see the damage she is doing. When Marie regains consciousness, Sara is long gone.
