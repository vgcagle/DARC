Striking Vipers
Danny hosts a birthday party with his wife Theo. His old friend Karl introduces him to the latest Striking Vipers game, as they used to play them together. It is a fighting game, now experienced in virtual reality. That night, Danny and Karl play as Lance and Roxette, respectively, feeling all physical sensations of the characters' bodies. After a round of fighting, they fall onto each other and kiss. They begin to have sex in the game. On their wedding anniversary, Theo confronts Danny, having noticed him being more withdrawn, and he cuts off his arrangement with Karl. At Danny's next birthday, Theo invites Karl. They argue but then have sex in the game again. They try kissing in real life, but agree that there is no spark between them. A physical fight leads to their arrest overnight. Later, as part of an agreement, Danny plays Striking Vipers with Karl while Theo goes to a bar without her wedding ring and meets strangers.
