White Bear
A woman wakes up in a house with amnesia. People on the street record her but do not speak. After being chased by a masked man, she flees and meets Jem, another woman hiding from those known as "hunters". Jem explains that the people recording her have been affected by a strange signal, while the hunters are unaffected sadists. The woman follows Jem in her plan to destroy the signal transmitter. A hunter, Baxter, holds them at gunpoint in a forest but Jem kills him. When they reach the facility, hunters attack. The woman wrestles a shotgun away but it only sprays confetti. The whole day has been a staged performance, and everybody but the woman—named Victoria Skillane—was an actor or audience member. Victoria was an accomplice to the child murderer Iain Rannoch. Victoria was sent to the White Bear Justice Park, wherein her memory is wiped at the end of each day so that the punishment and entertainment can begin afresh.
