Black Museum
Nish visits the Black Museum run by Rolo Haynes. He previously recruited people for experimental medical technology. One technology allowed Dr. Peter Dawson to feel the physical sensations of his patients to make diagnoses, but he began enjoying pain and was rendered comatose after killing a homeless man and experiencing his death. In another case, a comatose mother had her consciousness transferred into her husband's head, but after arguments she was moved to a toy monkey which her child quickly abandoned. The main exhibit is a holographic Clayton Leighâ€”a man convicted of murder and put to death by electric chair. Visitors pull the lever to execute the sentient hologram, and get a souvenir clone copy to watch the death on repeat. Nish reveals herself as Clayton's daughter; she has given Rolo poisoned water so that he falls unconscious. Nish kills the hologram of Clayton and takes a souvenir of Rolo being given the electric chair. As she drives away, she speaks to her mother, whose consciousness has been transferred into her head.
