Nosedive
Using eye implants and mobile devices, people rate all of their social interactions on a five-star scale. These ratings form a person's overall rating, which affects their socioeconomic status. Lacie, rated 4.2, is keen to reach 4.5 to afford a better apartment. She leaps at the opportunity to be maid of honour at her childhood friend Naomi's wedding. Her flight there is cancelled and she is too low-rated to qualify for a replacement. She argues with a staff member and security temporarily subtracts a point from her rating and places her on "double damage", which increases the effect of poor ratings. With her new rating, she can only rent an old car, which breaks down. Lacie hitchhikes with Susanâ€”a truck driver rated 1.4. Naomi uninvites Lacie due to her lower rating, but she gatecrashes the wedding and attempts to deliver her speech. Increasingly agitated, Lacie grabs a knife as guests give her low ratings. Security arrest Lacie and she is taken to prison, where she and a fellow inmate revel in their newfound freedom from being rated.
