Walt is convinced that his medical condition is deteriorating; he continues to have coughing fits and is now coughing up blood. After Saul calculates the numbers, Walt realizes that there is not much money left for his family. With an excuse of visiting his mother, Walt and Jesse set off for the desert for a marathon cooking session over an extended weekend. During their trip, Jesse accidentally leaves the keys in the ignition, inadvertently draining the RV's battery. Walt and Jesse find themselves stuck in the middle of the desert, cold and without food and water. Walt's knowledge of chemistry again saves the day, as they build a makeshift battery able to jump-start the RV. Returning to Albuquerque, Walt and Skyler discover that Walt's cancer is in remission.
