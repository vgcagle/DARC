Walter White, a 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher facing a midlife crisis, finds out he has Stage 3, inoperable lung cancer. He keeps the news a secret from his pregnant wife, Skyler, and their teenage son, Walter Jr. Walt rides along with his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader, on a raid of a methamphetamine lab, in which they catch a cook/dealer named Emilio. Walt sees his former student-turned-meth cook/dealer, Jesse Pinkman, escape from the raid. Walt realizes he can use his knowledge of chemistry to cook meth and make enough to support his family after he dies. He enlists Jesse's help and they begin cooking in a remote area of the desert in an RV they buy. The pair create a pure, unadulterated form of crystal meth. Jesse tries to sell the meth they made, and one of the dealers is his ex-partner Emilio, who forces Jesse to show them the lab. Emilio recognizes Walt from the DEA raid and knocks Jesse unconscious for betraying him. Under the guise of teaching them his recipe, Walt poisons them with phosphine gas, knowing the dealers intend to kill them.
