Jesse becomes frustrated that he cannot secure stable employment. Walt and Skyler attend Walt's old friend Elliott's birthday. Skyler tells Elliott about Walt's cancer, and Elliott offers him a job which Walt declines, feeling insulted about an offer of financial help. Jesse attempts to cook meth on his own but cannot replicate the quality of Walt's product. Walt Jr. gets caught by an undercover cop trying to buy beer and calls Hank to save him instead of Walt. Walt's family attempts an intervention to persuade him to undergo chemotherapy; Marie says everyone should let Walt make the decision on his own, to Skyler's dismay. Walt tells everyone that he needs the agency to make a choice for himself and that he does not want to live his last days miserable with treatment. The next morning, he relents and tells Skyler he will accept Gretchen and Elliott's assistance. However, he calls Gretchen, who he used to have a relationship with, to tell that it isn't needed, lying that his insurance actually does cover treatment. He goes to Jesse's house and asks to resume their partnership.
