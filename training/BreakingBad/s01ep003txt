Skyler's sister, Marie, believes that Walter Jr. is smoking marijuana and asks Hank to scare him straight. Hank takes Walt Jr. to a drug house to teach him about gateway drugs. Walt and Jesse clean up the remains of Emilio. Walt is torn between whether to keep Krazy-8 alive or kill him. Krazy-8 gets in Walt's head and creates mistrust and conflict between him and Jesse. While bringing Krazy-8 food, he collapses while descending the stairs. Upon waking up, Walt tells Krazy-8 that he has lung cancer—the first person he tells—and they start sharing the unexpected things they have in common. Walt decides to release Krazy-8, but while disposing of the shards of a broken plate he sees that a shard is missing, and realizes that Krazy-8 has concealed it to use as a weapon. When Walt confronts Krazy-8 with this information, Krazy-8 attacks him, so Walt strangles and kills him with the bicycle lock restraint. Walt lies and tells Skyler he was working late at the car wash, but she has already talked to his boss and knows he quit weeks ago. That night, when Walter gets home, he tells Skyler that he has something to tell her, and, off-camera, reveals his cancer diagnosis.
