Walt and Jesse try to dispose of the two bodies in the RV, which becomes increasingly complicated when one of them, Krazy-8, wakes up and escapes. Walt finds him barely conscious walking along the street and puts him in his car. They eventually imprison him in Jesse's basement. Meanwhile, Skyler grows suspicious of Walt's recent behavior. She asks him about Jesse, whom she discovers after he calls Walt at their home, and Walt covers by telling her that Jesse sells him marijuana. Skyler visits Jesse and threatens to call Hank if Jesse contacts Walt about marijuana again. Jesse disposes of Emilio's body using hydrofluoric acid as Walt instructs, but he ignores Walt's warning to use a plastic bin and uses his bathtub instead, resulting in a heavy clean-up when the acid eats through the floor below. Two children playing in the desert area where the RV had been find a gas mask that Walt and Jesse left there.
